# OctoAcme — Project Management Process Overview

This repository’s `docs/` folder contains the living documentation for OctoAcme’s scalable project management practices and programs. All teammates use these artifacts and workflows to ensure projects are consistent, transparent, and effective.

## Purpose

- Centralize program/project management knowledge in an accessible location.
- Convert team experience (“tacit knowledge”) into versioned, searchable artifacts.
- Ensure all team members have equal access to processes, decisions, roles, and rationale.
- Accelerate onboarding and minimize risk from knowledge silos.
- Enable repeatable, high-quality execution.

## Project Management Lifecycle

OctoAcme projects progress through these stages:

1. **Initiation:** Problem definition, stakeholder alignment, measurable objectives, and approval.
2. **Planning:** Backlog creation, risk assessment, milestones, and capacity alignment.
3. **Execution & Tracking:** Daily standups, project boards, PR and CI conventions, risk and blocker management, demos.
4. **Release & Deployment:** Review criteria, pre-release checklists, automated pipelines, incident playbooks.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Capture learnings, improve processes, follow up on action items.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Manager (PM):** Delivery coordination, scheduling, risk management, and reporting.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Outcome definition, backlog, stakeholder alignment, customer impact.
- **Developers:** Build/test software, maintain documentation, propose process improvements.
- **QA/Testing:** Validate release quality.
- **Stakeholders:** Input, approval, and escalation.

## Communication Cadence

- Weekly PM/PdM syncs and status updates
- Twice-weekly team standups
- Monthly (or milestone) stakeholder briefings
- Real-time escalation for critical risks/blockers
